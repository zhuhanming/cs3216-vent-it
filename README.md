## What is Vent It? 
Vent It’s goal is very simple: to be an avenue for one to let their stress out. At the core of it, the web app allows users to type in whatever pain points they have, and let it out by screaming into the phone. The app will assign an “anger rating” based on how loud the scream was, and add it to a diary. Of course, ultimately our goal is to help people de-stress, so these pain points will eventually “fade away” and be archived as time passes (dependent on the anger rating).

> Unfortunately, the app has been taken down due to the team's limited finances. We hope everyone had fun using it!
